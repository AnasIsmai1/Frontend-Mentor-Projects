## My process
I started out by making the desktop version of the project. I created the necessary div.s and semantic tags where they were needed. I kept all the info within a container on which I applied some padding and necessary layout adjustments using flex-box. I created the badge just below the image. I set the picture tag with auto adjust height and with max width available along side with the padding within the container. I kept the Avatar and Name at the bottom by using positioning and adjust the position from the bottom of the div. At the i used three media queries to adjust the image size and font size for necessary sizes.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex-box
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

With this project I got to understand how to make an image responsive with change in screen size.


### Continued development

I want to find a way to be more efficient with my media queries and use as less as them.
