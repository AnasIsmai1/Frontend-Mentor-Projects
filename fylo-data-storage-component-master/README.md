## My process

I first started off with the mobile first version of the website which just involved setting the right background image and then creating two cards within the container. After that i gave the proper tags to all the content within both the cards. In the first card i set the border radius, the height, the width and the color of the card. I then adjusted the sizes of the logo and the icons of the images in the first card. i followed this with adjusting the font weights and sizes in the second card adding span tags to specific elements with greater size and weight within a sentence. I then created a progress bar, the process of which just included the creation of the bg of the bar the bar itself and adding the gradient colour the bar. At the end i added a white ball to the bar. I crated a popup for the amount of storage left. As i added a media query i adjusted the flex direction and then added the pointer to the popup.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### Continued development

I would like to improve the size aspect ratio and the background image for the mobile cersion of the website. I had a hard time choosing wether to set the background as an img tag or as the background-image to the body.
