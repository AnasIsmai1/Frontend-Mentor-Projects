## My process
I started out my process by first making a mobile first version of the design. I created a container gave it a width and then created cards within it while giving them properties. I then created profile div with the pfp and the name of the blog owner and their status. I each of the cards their respective colors and the added a gap in between them. I then turned to create the desktop version of the website which involved a grid. I had a time figuring the correct grid sizes but once i got them i adjusted the font sizes. I then adjusted the size of some cards accross the rows and brought the last to the third column on the first row. I proceed to create a design for  smaller laptops by removing the last coumn and bringing the last column to last row.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex-box
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this project I got to practice grids a lot more and then made a better use of the grids by creating a tablet and small laptop version for the website.
