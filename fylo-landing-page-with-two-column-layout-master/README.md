## My process
I started out with the mobile version of the website. I divided the website into five sections namely the header, the first section, the section, the newsletter, the footer.
I started out with the header which just involved creating a navbar and adding the logo and using flex to add space between them. In the first section I added a picture and the necessary components such as headings, paragraphs and a form with an email input and a button. I gave the container a percentage width to give it some responsiveness. In the second I added a picture along with similar components from the first section with the addition of a quote card component and a link which leads to another page. I then moved over to the newsletter portion which plainly simple was just a smaller version of the first section. In the footer i added the logo along with the necessary images for some info within the footer i used the flexbox to justify to the right and gave them gaps for some presentation. After that I moved on to the desktop version of the website in which I arranged the container in grid layout with 50% layout for both  the picture and the content itself. After doing this for both container I did the same for the newsletter I then added the hover animations for the buttons and a tags. At the end i finished the project after adjusting the layout of the footer.

### Continued development

If able to i would like to add a tablet version to this website. I am looking into how to make a website efficient for screen readers although i didn't add any of those findings into this website but i will do so in the future.
