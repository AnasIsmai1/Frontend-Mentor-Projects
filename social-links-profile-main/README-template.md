## My process
I started out by making the desktop version of the project. I created the necessary variables in my CSS file and then began with the background then the card, followed by the footer. The footer didn't take much time. I adjusted the width for the card then the height for the page itself for a more centered look. Made the necessary divs for all the data, arranged them within the card using flex box and gave them the necessary gaps. After a bit of styling I then just gave the hover and focus states for the buttons hence concluding most of the development process. After adding a media query for the mobile version the project was hence completed.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

With this project i got to understand the focus state and its various types such as the :focus-visible and the :focus-within which allows us to add necessary properties we need for the specific use-case scenario.


### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
